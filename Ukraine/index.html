                  Kyiv and Kharkiv lend its vibe from its Soviet past while
                fostering and breaking its way out for a new and unique identity
                of its own. Odesa is also its own thing with a perfect blend
                between cultures from the people (Turks, Slavs, etc.) that
                inhabited the place, while Yaremche maintains their folk culture
                shared among several countries in the Carpathian Mountains.

              <p class="text-right">
                In general, the best time to visit Ukraine is either side of summer in
                May-June or September. Temperatures are comfortable, sightseeing is less
                crowded and there are fewer holiday makers flocking to the Black Sea
                beach resorts around Odessa. Spring blossom in the Carpathians makes
                Apr-May an extremely attractive time of year although it can still get
                chilly, especially at night. If you can withstand the heat, humidity and
                thunder storms of Jul-Aug, city sightseeing can be surprisingly
                uncrowded as many Ukrainians head south to the coast or bolt to their
                country cottages.

          <br>
          <p class = "chernobyl text-left">On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, Soviet Union suffered a massive explosion that released radioactive material across Belarus, Russia and Ukraine and as far as Scandinavia and western Europe. Chernobyl dramatizes the story of the 1986 accident, one of the worst man-made catastrophes in history, and the sacrifices made to save Europe from the unimaginable disaster. 
          <br><br>
          On April 27 the 30,000 inhabitants of Prypyat began to be evacuated. A cover-up was attempted, but on April 28 Swedish monitoring stations reported abnormally high levels of wind-transported radioactivity and pressed for an explanation. The Soviet government admitted there had been an accident at Chernobyl, thus setting off an international outcry over the dangers posed by the radioactive emissions. By May 4 both the heat and the radioactivity leaking from the reactor core were being contained, albeit at great risk to workers. Radioactive debris was buried at some 800 temporary sites, and later in the year the highly radioactive reactor core was enclosed in a concrete-and-steel sarcophagus (which was later deemed structurally unsound).
          <br><br> Are you familiar with the term Dark Tourism? Visitors to Ukraine can add the <strong>Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant</strong>, ground zero for the disaster, to the list.
